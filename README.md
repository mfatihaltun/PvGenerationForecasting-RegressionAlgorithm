# PvGenerationForecasting-RegressionAlgorithm
My Capstone Project about Python Machine Learning on the 2020-2021 Semester at Ag√º

I want to demonstrate my Capstone Project I was conducted for 2 semesters.
In this project which is basically solar Panels PV Generation Forecasting, I have been built Regression algorithms that are important for PV generation forecasting.
I tried to improve the algorithm by examining values such as OLS report, R2 score etc.
I used some previous dateset from internet and I received some reel current datasets from some companies.

I added to dataset link which in kaggle : [Solar Power Generation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipulgote4/solar-power-generation)

### The Regression Algorithms that I used in the project
* Multi Linear Regression
* Support Vector Regression
* Polinomial Regression 
  * 2nd order and 4th order
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Regression
